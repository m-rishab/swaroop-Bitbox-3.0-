# Swaroop: Blockchain + Generative AI for Endangered Species Avatars

## Overview

Swaroop is a groundbreaking web application that combines blockchain technology, generative AI, and a commitment to wildlife conservation. The project aims to raise awareness about endangered species by allowing users to create unique avatars representing at-risk animals. Users can mint these avatars as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using Metamask, adding a layer of ownership and rarity to their creations.

## Features

### Generative AI Avatars

Harness the power of the Stable Diffusion API to generate visually captivating avatars. Each avatar is a creative representation of an endangered species, highlighting the unique features of these animals.

### Blockchain Integration

Seamlessly integrate with the Ethereum blockchain using Metamask. Users can take ownership of their generated avatars by minting them as NFTs, creating a decentralized and secure way to showcase and trade their creations.

### Educational Insights

Enrich the user experience with educational content sourced from Wikipedia. Learn more about the endangered species you're creating avatars for, fostering a deeper understanding of the challenges these animals face.

### Impactful Conservation

By creating and sharing avatars on Swaroop, users contribute to a collective effort to raise awareness about endangered species. The project emphasizes the importance of preserving biodiversity and inspires a sense of responsibility and collective action.
